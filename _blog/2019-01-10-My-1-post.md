This website was built in <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/midzer/urban-theme">urban-theme</a>.

I am quite the dummy for computery stuff but this is a great way of setting up a simple website as this one. Really, once everything is set and functioning the knowledge you need to update the content is minimal and you have the freedom of updating whenever you want and total control over how you want to display your content. Oh, and it's free.

I wanted to make a more in depth report of the process but I no longer remember the details of the couple of issues that I had, soooorry. But really, once you get past the lingo, have everything installed and learn the very basics you are ready to rock and roll.
