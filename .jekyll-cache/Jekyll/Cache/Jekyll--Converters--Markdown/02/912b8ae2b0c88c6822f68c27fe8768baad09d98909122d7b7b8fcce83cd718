Little therapeutic zine from my experience with adult onset acne. One day I thought that it looked like my pimples never disappeared, they only moved from one place of my face to a different one. They camped somewhere for a while and then left somewhere else. That made me laugh and I made this little comic. Hand screen-printed in three colors by yours truly.

  &lt;/div&gt;
