<p>Loneliness, fears and making peace with our demons is a recurrent theme in my work. I had this idea and thought it would look great as a T-shirt. Because why not? It is very much in vogue to share one‚Äôs own troubledness. So I endeavoured to produce some of them myself. I used phosphorescent ink so that they glow in the dark. It was a very small batch for friends and former lovers but if you want one hit me up, I might make more soon.
I made them on white and also on black fabric.<br /><br />
