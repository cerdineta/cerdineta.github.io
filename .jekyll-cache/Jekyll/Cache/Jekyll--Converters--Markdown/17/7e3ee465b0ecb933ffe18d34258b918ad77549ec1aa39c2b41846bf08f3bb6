The patches were to be placed on a sweatshirt that I finally got comissioned to design as well.

They wanted the design to make reference to a sort of tradition of gallician origins called <i>queimada</i>. In that ritual, orujo liquour is infused with fruits and spices and burnt in a special pot while reading out loud a spell or <i>conxuro</i> and then drunk all together. The cultural association has adopted this tradition and they do it also once a year, as part of the preparations for the fest.<br />

<p>The members of the association chose the design they preferred among the different propositions, some of them you can see here, and then I screenprinted all of the sweatshirts by myself because it was the month of july and not a single screen printing workshop in Barcelona wanted to work with white opaque water-based inks in the heat of the summer.</p>
