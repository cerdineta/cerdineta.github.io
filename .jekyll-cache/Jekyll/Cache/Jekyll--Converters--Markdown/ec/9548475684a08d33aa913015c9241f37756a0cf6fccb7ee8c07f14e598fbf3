I"+<p>I worked together with Papamolo agency in Madrid in the branding of Sonqo, a lawyer firm specializing in culture to create these illustrations that became part of the branding of their website.</p>

I created several elements related to the craft and work of artists that related somehow to the shape of a heart because that is the meaning of the name of the firm and they wanted to make reference to the passion with which artists and creators work. <br />
Then, I imagined in which scenarios would these objects live and how would they be used by artists, without a care in the world because they have the support of these lawyers. They could be totally absorbed with the creative act, oblivious to other concerns.
