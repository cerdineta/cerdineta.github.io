<p>I previously collaborated designing a collection of patches for the cultural association of my hometown <a href="https://www.instagram.com/som_tribu_/">La tribu</a> invested primarily in a carnivallesque parade that takes place every year at the end of August. The patches were to be placed on a sweatshirt that I finally got comissioned to design as well. They wanted the design to make reference to a sort of tradition of gallician origins called <i>queimada</i>. In that tradicion, orujo liquour is infused with fruits and spices and burnt in a special pot while reading out loud a spell or <i>conxuro</i> and then drunk all together. It has become an internal tradition of this association to do this ritual every year.</p>
