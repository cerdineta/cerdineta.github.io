The following images were created for a collective calendar for the year 2019 made with the team of <a href="https://yuncuernoediciones.tumblr.com/">Â¡Y UN CUERNO! EDICIONES</a> then I adapted them for being produced as screen prints. I make all screenprints at home in a completely analogic way with hand made transparencies. You can learn more about the process in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/">blog</a>.
